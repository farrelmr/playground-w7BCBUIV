# Java 8 – Streams Cookbook

The origins of this article were my original blog post [Java 8 - Streams Cookbook](https://www.javabullets.com/java-8-streams-cookbook/). This article provided a single main method and a number of different Streams examples. This post re-writes the article interactively using tech.io.

Streams in Java 8 provide a declarative approach to Collections. The simplest analogy is the your Collection is a water butt, and when you turn the tap(faucet) you create a stream which you can then process.

The advantages of Streams are –

1. Declarative
2. Parallelisable
3. Reduced Boilerplate – internal iteration

The Stream operations are either –

1. Intermediate – return streams
2. Terminal – produce result

# Cookbook

This Java template lets you get started quickly with a simple working example using Maven and JUnit. If it is your first contribution then you should have a look at the [Getting Started](https://tech.io/doc/getting-started-create-playground) document.


The source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/TechDotIO/java-template), please feel free to come up with proposals to improve it.

# Hands-on Demo

Check out the markdown file [`welcome.md`](https://github.com/TechDotIO/java-template/blob/master/markdowns/welcome.md) to see how this exercise is injected into the template.

# Template Resources

[`markdowns/welcome.md`](https://github.com/TechDotIO/java-template/blob/master/markdowns/welcome.md)
What you are reading here is generated by this file. Tech.io uses the [Markdown syntax](https://tech.io/doc/reference-markdowns) to render text, media and to inject programming exercises.


[`java-project`](https://github.com/TechDotIO/java-template/tree/master/java-project)
A simple Java + Maven + JUnit project dedicated to run the programming exercise above. A project relies on a Docker image to run. You can find images on the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/explore/) or you can even [build your own](https://tech.io/doc/reference-runner).


[`techio.yml`](https://github.com/TechDotIO/java-template/blob/master/techio.yml)
This *mandatory* file describes both the table of content and the programming project(s). The file path should not be changed.


# Visual and Interactive Content

Tech.io provides all the tools to embed visual and interactive content like a Web app or a Unix terminal within your contribution. Please refer to the [documentation](https://tech.io/doc) to learn more about the viewer integrations.
